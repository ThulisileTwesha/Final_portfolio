    I have completed a degree that allowed me to major in Information Systems and midst its completion,
    I became curious on learning about coding after seeing Women In Tech who would talk about their 
    journeys but at that time I had no vast information of where to go or where to start. 
    
    I got an opportunity to join the Absa learnership this year and has been a life changing experience. 
    I now have experience in a number of coding languages and frameworks. I am still learning and 
    improving my skills continuously. I believe web design can be more diverse and inspiring,  
    with a mission to present the possibilities of web design. I am pursuing new expressions through experiments and thoughts.</p>
